            <h2>Industrial Effluents</h2>
            <p>Wastes from factories contain heavy metals and other pollutants, contaminating the water. For instance, the sea off Teluk Bahang is reported to be contaminated by heavy metals. <strong>(Source: CEMACS)</strong></p>

            <h2>Sewage and Domestic Waste</h2>
            <p>The contribution of untreated or partially treated sewage to water quality deterioration has been reported, with perpetual pollution near Sungai Pinang. <strong>(Source: FOE Malaysia)</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Urban Runoff</h2>
            <p>Stormwater runoff from urban areas carries pollutants like gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, fertilizers, and pesticides into water bodies, leading to sedimentation and nutrient pollution. <strong>(Source: Wikipedia)</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Marine Activities</h2>
            <p>Accidental spills and deliberate waste dumping from vessels pollute waters, destroying coral and seagrass habitats. These activities threaten coastal ecosystems and communities. <strong>(Source: POGO)</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Agricultural Runoff</h2>
            <p>Fertilizers and pesticides from agriculture enter rivers and coastal waters, causing nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Solid Waste Disposal</h2>
            <p>Improper disposal of plastics and other debris leads to trash accumulation in waterways, affecting water quality and marine life.</p>

            <h2>River Pollution in Penang</h2>
            <p>The Pinang River, flowing through George Town, is one of the most polluted in Penang. From 2006 to 2016, its Water Quality Index (WQI) ranged from Class III (requiring extensive treatment) to Class IV (suitable only for irrigation). Although rehabilitation efforts were made, its quality has not consistently improved. <strong>(Source: UNU Collections)</strong></p>

            <h2>Coastal Pollution in Penang</h2>
            <p>Pollution in Teluk Bahang led to the deaths of nearly 50,000 fish in April 2019 due to heavy metal contamination, including nickel, lead, and cadmium. The exact source remains unknown, but illegal dumping and dredging are suspected. <strong>(Source: POGO)</strong></p>

            <h2>Major Sources of Pollution</h2>
            <p>Untreated domestic sewage, industrial effluents, and animal husbandry waste are significant pollution sources. The Kereh River has suffered from pollution due to untreated swine farming activities in Kampung Selamat for over 40 years. <strong>(Source: PubMed)</strong></p>

        <section>
            <h2>Need for Action</h2>
            <p>Penang urgently needs integrated water management, pollution control, and community participation to protect aquatic ecosystems and public health.</p>
