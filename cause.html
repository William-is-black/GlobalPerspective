            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-4">Industrial Effluents</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Wastes from factories contain heavy metals and other pollutants, which contaminate the water. 
                The sea off Teluk Bahang has been reported to be polluted with heavy metals.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Sewage and Domestic Waste</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The contribution of untreated or partially treated sewage has been reported to deteriorate water quality, 
                particularly in areas near Sungai Pinang.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Urban Runoff</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Stormwater runoff from urban areas carries pollutants like gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, fertilizers, and pesticides into water bodies. 
                This leads to increased sedimentation and nutrient loading, further deteriorating water quality.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Marine Activities</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Accidental spills and deliberate dumping of waste from vessels contribute pollutants that destroy coral and seagrass habitats, 
                threatening coastal ecosystems.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Agricultural Runoff</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural activities wash into rivers and coastal waters, leading to nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Solid Waste Disposal</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Improper disposal of solid waste, including plastics and other debris, results in the accumulation of trash in waterways, 
                affecting both water quality and marine life.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-8 mb-4">Water Pollution Issues in Penang</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Penang faces serious water pollution problems, affecting both rivers and coastal waters.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">River Pollution</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The Pinang River, flowing through George Town, has long been considered one of the most polluted rivers in Penang. 
                From 2006 to 2016, its Water Quality Index (WQI) ranged between Class III (requiring extensive treatment) and Class IV (only suitable for irrigation). 
                While rehabilitation efforts have been made, its water quality has not significantly improved.

            <p class="mb-4">
                A study analyzing 11 rivers around Penang Island (2012â€“2013) reported an average WQI of 54.67, classifying the rivers as moderately polluted (Class III).

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Coastal Pollution</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                In April 2019, almost 50,000 fish were found dead in Teluk Bahang due to a sudden decline in water quality. 
                Heavy metals such as nickel, lead, and cadmium were detected, but the exact source of contamination remains unclear. 
                Illegal dumping or dredging is suspected.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Untreated domestic sewage</li>
                <li>Industrial effluents</li>
                <li>Wastes from animal husbandry (e.g., swine farming in Kampung Selamat)</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mt-8 mb-4">The Need for Action</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                These pollution issues highlight the urgent need for integrated water management, pollution control, and environmental conservation 
                efforts to protect aquatic ecosystems and public health in Penang.
