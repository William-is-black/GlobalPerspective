            <h2>India: Facing Water Pollution Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                In India, nearly 70% of surface water is contaminated due to untreated sewage, industrial waste, and agricultural runoff. Efforts like *Namami Gange* aim to address this, but significant challenges remain in enforcement and infrastructure.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>High levels of untreated sewage and industrial waste</li>
                <li>Laws like the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act</li>
                <li>Infrastructure and technological gaps</li>
