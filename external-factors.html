            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-4">Industrial Waste</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Factories release untreated or partially treated wastewater containing harmful chemicals such as solvents, oils, heavy metals, and toxic elements. 
                These pollutants cause immense environmental devastation (EPA, Britannica).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Industrial activities also contribute to <strong>thermal pollution</strong>, where heated water from industrial processes is discharged into rivers, 
                disrupting aquatic ecosystems and harming marine life.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Sewage and Wastewater</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Poorly managed sewage systems in both urban and rural areas often discharge untreated or partially treated wastewater into water bodies. 
                This introduces pathogens, nutrients, and chemicals, leading to waterborne diseases.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Agricultural Runoff</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Agricultural fertilizers contain <strong>nitrates and phosphates</strong>, which leach into water systems through runoff. 
                Pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals from farming further contaminate rivers and lakes, causing <strong>nutrient pollution</strong>, 
                algal blooms, and the degradation of water quality (EPA, Fair Planet).
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Plastic Pollution</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Improper waste disposal leads to significant amounts of plastic waste entering rivers, lakes, and oceans. Over time, plastics break down into <strong>microplastics</strong>, 
                which harm aquatic life and can enter the food chain, posing health risks.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Mining Activities</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Mining operations release toxic substances such as <strong>cyanide, mercury, and sulfuric acid</strong> into nearby water bodies. 
                These chemicals have long-term detrimental effects on aquatic life and contaminate surrounding water sources (EPA).
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Climate Change</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Climate change is exacerbating water pollution by altering temperature and precipitation patterns. Warmer waters contribute to the growth of <strong>toxic algal blooms</strong>, 
                which deplete oxygen levels and release harmful toxins into water bodies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Urbanization</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Increased urbanization leads to more <strong>impervious surfaces</strong> such as roads and buildings, which increase stormwater runoff. 
                This runoff carries pollutants like oils, heavy metals, and chemicals from urban streets into nearby water sources.
