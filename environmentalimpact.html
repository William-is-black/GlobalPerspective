                            Water pollution has severely impacted Penang's marine ecosystems. Coral reefs around the island have experienced bleaching and degradation due to increased water temperatures, sedimentation, and chemical pollutants.

                            The waters around Penang were once rich in marine biodiversity, but pollution has led to significant declines in fish populations and other marine life. Local fishermen report catching fewer species and smaller fish compared to previous decades.

                            Nutrient pollution from agricultural runoff and sewage has led to harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Penang's coastal waters. These blooms deplete oxygen levels in the water, creating "dead zones" where marine life cannot survive.

                            Mangrove forests, critical for coastal protection and as nurseries for marine life, have been affected by pollution and development. Penang has lost approximately 40% of its mangrove coverage since the 1980s.

                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    The environmental impacts of water pollution in Penang are wide-ranging and interconnected. Degradation of marine ecosystems leads to biodiversity loss, which affects fisheries and food security. The destruction of habitats like coral reefs and mangroves reduces coastal protection, making the island more vulnerable to erosion and storm damage. Addressing these issues requires comprehensive approaches that tackle pollution at its sources and work to restore damaged ecosystems.
