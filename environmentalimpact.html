            <p class="mb-4">
                Water pollution in Penang poses a serious threat to rivers, marine ecosystems, and coastal waters. 
                Polluted rivers like <strong>Sungai Pinang</strong>, affected by industrial waste, untreated sewage, and litter, 
                have led to oxygen depletion, habitat destruction, and mass fish kills.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>Plastic pollution</strong> is a major concern, endangering marine species due to ingestion and entanglement. 
                Nearby <strong>coral reefs</strong> are at risk due to sediment runoff from farming and construction, 
                which threatens biodiversity and disrupts tourism. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Additionally, pollution weakens natural buffers like <strong>wetlands and mangrove forests</strong>, 
                which act as barriers against erosion and floods. The destruction of these ecosystems threatens biodiversity, 
                disrupts fisheries, and impacts tourism, affecting the livelihoods of local communities.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Global Environmental Impacts of Water Pollution</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Water pollution is a critical global threat to ecosystems and biodiversity. 
                <strong>Eutrophication</strong>, caused by excessive nutrients from fertilizers, leads to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, 
                and mass die-offs of aquatic life.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The presence of <strong>plastics and microplastics</strong> in oceans affects marine animals and enters the food chain, 
                posing health risks to humans. Industrial chemicals and heavy metals contaminate water bodies, 
                causing long-term damage to freshwater and marine ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Additionally, water pollution disrupts <strong>natural carbon sinks</strong> such as mangroves and wetlands, 
                reducing their ability to absorb carbon dioxide and increasing climate-related vulnerabilities. 
                The loss of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems affects food security, increases the risk of natural disasters, 
                and diminishes cultural and recreational values associated with water bodies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">The Need for Action</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Combating water pollution requires global cooperation through <strong>strict legislation, improved waste management, 
                and sustainable practices</strong>. Governments, industries, and communities must work together to protect water resources 
                for future generations.
