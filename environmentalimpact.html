        <h2>Water Pollution in Penang</h2>
        <p>
            Water pollution in Penang poses significant threats, particularly to rivers, marine ecosystems, and coastal waters. Polluted rivers, such as Sungai Pinang, suffer from industrial waste, untreated sewage, and litter. These pollutants cause oxygen depletion and habitat destruction, leading to massive fish kills.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the major concerns is plastic pollution in Penang's waters, which endangers species through ingestion and entanglement. Coral reefs near Penang face great risk from sediment and chemicals caused by farming and construction activities. This not only threatens biodiversity but also impacts local tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wetlands and mangrove forests, vital for buffering erosion and blocking large inflows, are also affected by pollution. Their degradation jeopardizes biodiversity and local livelihoods, including fisheries and tourism for fisherfolk and visitors.
        </p>

        <h2>Global Environmental Impacts of Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>
            Globally, water pollution is a major threat to ecosystems and biodiversity. Eutrophication, caused by excess nutrients from fertilizers, leads to algal blooms that deplete oxygen and kill aquatic life. Plastics and microplastics invade oceans, harming marine animals and entering the food chain, affecting human health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Industrial chemicals and heavy metals contaminate water systems, causing long-term damage to freshwater and marine ecosystems. These pollutants also destroy natural carbon sinks like mangroves and wetlands. The loss of biodiversity reduces food security, increases vulnerability to natural disasters, and diminishes the cultural and recreational values of water bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Combating water pollution requires a global effort through enforcement of legislation, effective waste management, and sustainable practices.
