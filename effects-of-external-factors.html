                            Climate change has profound effects on Penang's water systems. Rising temperatures have led to increased evaporation rates, resulting in higher concentrations of pollutants in water bodies during dry periods.

                            More intense rainfall events, which have increased by 15% in frequency over the past decade, cause greater surface runoff that carries pollutants from land to water bodies.

                            Penang's population has grown to over 1.7 million, increasing pressure on water resources and waste management systems. Urban areas generate approximately 1,800 tons of solid waste daily, a portion of which finds its way into waterways.

                            The expansion of urban areas has led to a 30% reduction in natural drainage systems and wetlands, which previously filtered pollutants and absorbed excess water during heavy rainfall.

                            Penang's manufacturing and industrial sectors contribute significantly to the state's GDP but also generate substantial wastewater. The electronics industry alone produces an estimated 300,000 cubic meters of wastewater annually.

                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    The effects of external factors on water pollution in Penang are not isolated but interact in complex ways that often amplify their impact. For instance, climate change intensifies the effects of urbanization by increasing runoff from impervious surfaces during heavy rainfall events. Similarly, economic development drives both industrial growth and tourism, creating multiple sources of pollution that affect the same water bodies. Understanding these interconnections is essential for developing effective strategies to address water pollution in Penang.
