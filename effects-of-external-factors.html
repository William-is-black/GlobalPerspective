            <p class="mb-4">
                Industries, especially those near coastal areas, release enormous quantities of waste, including plastics and toxic chemicals, into water bodies. 
                These pollutants accumulate over time, leading to long-term pollution.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Agricultural Runoff</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides used in agriculture wash into rivers and oceans during rainfall, contaminating water sources. 
                Plastics used in farming, such as plastic films and containers, also contribute to water pollution.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Urban Development</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Urbanization increases impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt, which prevent water from soaking into the ground. 
                As a result, rainwater carrying plastics and waste flows directly into rivers, lakes, and oceans through storm drains.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Shipping and Maritime Activities</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Ships, particularly in busy maritime routes, frequently discharge plastic waste, packaging materials, and lost cargo into the ocean. 
                Commercial fishing operations also contribute to marine pollution through the loss of nets, fishing lines, and plastic equipment.
