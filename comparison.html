            <p class="mb-4">
                Water pollution is a major environmental issue affecting people worldwide. 
                The nature and severity of pollution vary across different regions due to factors such as industrial activity, 
                agricultural practices, population density, and economic development. While some areas face contamination from industrial waste and untreated sewage, 
                others suffer from agricultural runoff and pesticide pollution. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                In many developing regions, rapid urbanization and inadequate waste management worsen the crisis, 
                while developed nations deal with industrial pollution and emerging contaminants like microplastics. 
                Regardless of location, water pollution threatens human health, aquatic ecosystems, and the sustainability of industries and agriculture. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Japan's Approach to Water Pollution</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Japan is a leading example of how water pollution can be controlled through <strong>strict environmental laws, advanced wastewater treatment, and public involvement</strong>. 
                The <strong>Water Pollution Control Act</strong> enforces stringent standards for industrial waste discharge, 
                requiring centralized treatment plants and state-of-the-art technology to manage wastewater efficiently. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Urban areas in Japan use advanced stormwater systems to reduce runoff pollution, while rural regions manage agricultural waste 
                with eco-friendly practices. Additionally, public education campaigns and community projects foster a sense of environmental responsibility. 
                Japan has also successfully restored polluted water bodies such as <strong>Tokyo Bay</strong> and shares its expertise internationally, 
                setting a high global standard for water pollution control.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">India's Water Pollution Crisis</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                India faces a severe water pollution crisis, with <strong>nearly 70% of surface water contaminated</strong> due to untreated sewage, 
                industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and religious practices. This widespread pollution creates serious health and environmental challenges. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Efforts such as the <strong>Namami Gange</strong> initiative and the <strong>Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act</strong> 
                aim to tackle pollution in India's rivers, but enforcement remains a challenge. Infrastructure gaps in both rural and urban areas 
                make it difficult to implement effective waste treatment solutions on a large scale.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Key Differences Between Japan and India</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                While Japan has achieved success in water pollution management through advanced technology and strict law enforcement, 
                India struggles due to <strong>rapid urbanization, a growing population, and insufficient infrastructure</strong>. 
                Japan's use of centralized wastewater treatment, public engagement, and technological advancements ensures cleaner water, 
                whereas India still needs to improve its enforcement strategies and invest in better infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Despite these differences, both countries highlight the importance of <strong>government policies, technological innovation, and community involvement</strong> 
                in addressing water pollution issues. By improving enforcement and increasing public awareness, India can take steps toward achieving a cleaner and 
                more sustainable water system, similar to Japan.
