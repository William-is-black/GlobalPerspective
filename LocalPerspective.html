            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-4">The Impact on Local Communities</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                People in Penang, especially those living near rivers, constantly suffer from the stink and unpleasant appearance caused by water pollution. 
                In some places, the sea off <strong>Teluk Bahang</strong> is said to be contaminated by heavy metals, while in <strong>Nibong Tebal</strong>, 
                the water at the <strong>Sungai Tengah</strong> river mouth appears black—a problem fishermen claim has plagued them for about 10 years. 
                This is an alarming issue for residents’ health, as water pollution in Penang is a serious concern due to its impact on public health. 
                Poor water quality can cause waterborne diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, and skin infections. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Improperly disposed industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural runoff introduce harmful chemicals and pathogens into rivers and coastal waters. 
                This contamination affects not only drinking water supplies but also the seafood consumed by residents. 
                Fisherfolk and communities depending on rivers such as <strong>Sungai Pinang</strong> face long-term exposure to pollution, 
                leading to chronic health conditions and economic losses. Many locals emphasize the need for stricter regulations and improved waste management 
                to safeguard public health and access to clean water.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Effects on Local Industries</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Water pollution does not only harm daily lives but also negatively impacts local industries. 
                <strong>Aquaculture</strong>, for instance, is severely affected as contaminated seawater disrupts marine ecosystems. 
                Heavy metal contamination in the sea off <strong>Teluk Bahang</strong> and pollution in <strong>Sungai Tengah</strong> affect fish populations, 
                leading to economic losses for fishermen and fish farmers. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Contamination of heavy metals in water may also lead to <strong>bioaccumulation</strong> in fish and seafood, 
                making them unsafe for consumption and export. This further damages Penang’s fishing industry and economy.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Tourism and the Local Economy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Other industries reliant on clean water, such as <strong>tourism and recreation</strong>, also suffer. 
                Beaches and coastal areas that once attracted tourists become less appealing when pollution is evident. 
                This decline in tourism reduces the incomes of businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and tour operators. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Solutions and Future Actions</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Tackling water pollution requires addressing both environmental and economic concerns. 
                Efforts must include stricter waste management regulations, investment in water treatment facilities, and public awareness campaigns. 
                Sustainable solutions depend on collaboration between government agencies, industries, and local communities. 
                Only through coordinated efforts can Penang ensure clean water access while protecting both livelihoods and the environment.
