        <h2>Impact on Local Communities</h2>
        <p>People in Penang, especially those living near rivers, suffer from water pollution. In Teluk Bahang, the sea is contaminated by heavy metals, while in Nibong Tebal, the Sungai Tengah river mouth has been black for years. This pollution threatens residents' health, causing waterborne diseases like diarrhea and cholera. Improper waste disposal introduces harmful chemicals, affecting drinking water and seafood safety.</p>

        <h2>Effects on Local Industries</h2>
        <p>Water pollution severely impacts industries. Aquaculture suffers due to contaminated seawater, harming fish populations. Heavy metals in seafood make it unsafe for consumption and export, affecting Penang’s economy. Tourism is also affected—polluted beaches drive away visitors, reducing income for hotels, restaurants, and tour operators.</p>
