            <h2>External Factors Affecting Water Pollution</h2>

            <h3>Industrial Waste</h3>
            <p>Factories release untreated or partially treated wastewater containing harmful chemicals like solvents, oils, and heavy metals. These pollutants cause immense environmental devastation (EPA, Britannica).</p>
            <p>Industrial activities also contribute to thermal pollution, where heated water from industrial processes is released into rivers, affecting aquatic life and ecosystems.</p>

            <h3>Sewage and Wastewater</h3>
            <p>Poorly managed sewage systems discharge untreated or partially treated wastewater into water bodies, introducing pathogens and chemicals. This leads to waterborne diseases.</p>

            <h3>Agricultural Runoff</h3>
            <p>Fertilizers contain nitrates and phosphates that leach into water systems, causing nutrient pollution, algal blooms, and water degradation. Pesticides and herbicides further contaminate rivers and lakes (EPA, Fair Planet).</p>

            <h3>Plastic Waste</h3>
            <p>Improper waste disposal allows plastic waste to reach rivers, lakes, and oceans. Over time, plastics break down into microplastics, which harm aquatic life and enter the food chain.</p>

            <h3>Mining Activities</h3>
            <p>Mining releases toxic substances such as cyanide, mercury, and sulfuric acid into nearby water bodies. These chemicals have long-term effects on aquatic ecosystems and water contamination (EPA).</p>

            <h3>Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Climate change worsens water pollution by altering temperature and precipitation patterns. Warmer waters promote toxic algal blooms, which deplete oxygen and release toxins.</p>

            <h3>Urbanization</h3>
            <p>Urban development increases impervious surfaces like roads and buildings, leading to stormwater runoff. This runoff carries pollutants such as oils, heavy metals, and chemicals into local water bodies.</p>
