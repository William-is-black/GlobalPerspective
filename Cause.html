            <h2>Major Causes of Water Pollution</h2>
            <p><strong>Industrial Effluents:</strong> Wastes from factories contain heavy metals and other pollutants, contaminating water. For instance, the sea off Teluk Bahang is contaminated by heavy metals. <em>(CEMACS)</em></p>

            <p><strong>Sewage and Domestic Waste:</strong> Untreated or partially treated sewage contributes to water quality deterioration. Pollution near Sungai Pinang is a long-standing issue. <em>(FOE Malaysia)</em></p>

            <p><strong>Urban Runoff:</strong> Stormwater runoff from urban areas carries gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, fertilizers, and pesticides, causing sedimentation and nutrient loading. <em>(Wikipedia)</em></p>

            <p><strong>Marine Activities:</strong> Accidental spills and deliberate dumping from vessels destroy coral and seagrass habitats, threatening coastal ecosystems. <em>(POGO)</em></p>

            <p><strong>Agricultural Runoff:</strong> Fertilizers and pesticides lead to nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms.</p>

            <p><strong>Solid Waste Disposal:</strong> Improper disposal of plastics and debris accumulates in waterways, degrading water quality and harming marine life.</p>

            <h2>Pollution in Penangâ€™s Water Bodies</h2>
            <h3>River Pollution</h3>
            <p>The Pinang River, flowing through George Town, is among the most polluted in Penang. From 2006 to 2016, its Water Quality Index (WQI) ranged from Class III (extensive treatment needed) to Class IV (only suitable for irrigation). Despite rehabilitation efforts, its quality has not significantly improved. <em>(UNU Collections)</em></p>

            <p>A study analyzing 11 rivers on Penang Island (2012-2013) found an average WQI of 54.67, classifying them as moderately polluted (Class III). <em>(ResearchGate)</em></p>

            <h3>Coastal Pollution</h3>
            <p>In April 2019, pollution struck Teluk Bahang, killing nearly 50,000 fish due to a sharp water quality decline. Heavy metals such as nickel, lead, and cadmium were detected. The source remains uncertain, but illegal dumping or dredging is suspected. <em>(POGO)</em></p>

            <h2>Sources of Pollution</h2>
            <p>Untreated domestic sewage, industrial waste, and animal farming runoff are major pollution sources. For over 40 years, the Kereh River has suffered from untreated swine farming waste in Kampung Selamat. <em>(PubMed)</em></p>

            <p>These figures indicate Penang urgently needs integrated water management, stricter pollution control, and conservation efforts to protect its aquatic ecosystems and public health.</p>
