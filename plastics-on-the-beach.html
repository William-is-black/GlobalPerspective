            <p class="mb-4">
                Many plastics end up on beaches due to improper disposal by individuals. People often litter plastic items such as bags, bottles, and packaging, which are then carried by wind or water into the ocean.

            <p class="mb-4">
                Plastics in the ocean are transported by currents over long distances, eventually washing up on beachesâ€”even in remote or protected areas. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a major accumulation zone for ocean plastics.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Lack of Recycling</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Many plastics are not recycled due to inefficient waste management systems or improper waste segregation. As a result, large amounts of plastic waste end up in rivers and oceans, eventually polluting beaches.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Tourism and Recreation</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Popular tourist destinations, especially coastal areas, often experience increased littering. Visitors leave behind plastic bottles, food wrappers, and other single-use plastic items, which are carried by wind and waves onto beaches.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6 mb-4">Fishing and Marine Industry</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Abandoned fishing gear (ghost nets), plastic ropes, and other discarded items from the fishing industry contribute to plastic pollution on beaches. These materials are often lost at sea or intentionally discarded.
